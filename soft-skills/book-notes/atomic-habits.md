# Atomic Habits

*Atomic Habits* by James Clear builds up on concepts from *Power of Habit* to support reader with building up desired habits and weeding out bad ones.

## Progress takes time

Most important thing to understand about building, maintaining and profiting from habits like daily workout, writing one page of your book a day, practicing sculpting, drawing or simply learning regularly is that **progress takes time**. 

It's the same for most of the aspects in our life. We build up proficiency in our jobs throughout the years. We accumulate wealth through long-term investments, not by - in general - strike of luck with one good investment on first try.

Everything takes time. But it accumulates. <br>
Everyday progress builds up on progress from previous day.<br>
1% improvement might look small, but like compound interest, it eventually builds up to enormous numbers (or whatever measurement one would use).


## Goal is a lie

James Clear points out an important thing that I've been practicing throghout my career - goals (or at least joy of reaching them) are ephemeral.

Both winners and loosers will both have same goals. But it doesn't make them successful per se.

## It's who you are, not what you've achieved

Instead of focusing on them, one should embrace the systeme of values, the identity of what the change we are looking is embodiment of.

I like to think about this when I think about myself *being a great software engineer*.<br>
Will I become one when I master one programming language? Or two? Or three? Does knowledge of this database, that message broker, that cloud provider or that design pattern will make me a great engineer?

Yes and no. Temporarily and given optimistic circumstances - perhaps. But time flows, technology changes, job market changes, world changes.<br>
Technology XYZ does not make me a great engineer. A certains path in life does - of continous learning, asking the question "why?", trying different problem domains, tackling different categories of problems, playing different roles in a team or organization as a whole.

This doesn't stand for single point of time when it's done. It's a continous process of **being that person**. Of **embracing such identity**.

I like to think about it in one other way, using two (shorter and longer) quotes from Brandon Sanderson's *The Way of Kings*:

>“And so, does the destination matter? Or is it the path we take? I declare that no accomplishment has substance nearly as great as the road used to achieve it. We are not creatures of destinations. It is the journey that shapes us. Our callused feet, our backs strong from carrying the weight of our travels, our eyes open with the fresh delight of experiences lived.”

and the one that summarizes it:

>“Journey before Destination.”

## Cheating oneself into habits

*Atomic Habits* is a gem in self-help category because it does not attempt to trick you into XYZ solution (ie. wake up at 5AM to be successful, force yourself to do ABC each day etc.). Instead it points you out, that indeed, we - as humans - are weak and we do optimize for short-term benefits, including mostly reward, pleasure, prize, you name it.

And instead of fighting it, James Cleary shows how to win this fight without actually fighting it (Sun Tzu pun intended).

He focuses on 4 "laws" of habit (both good and bad):
- cue/signal
- craving/desire
- response/reaction
- reward

## Signal - make things obvious

First thing is that starts every habit is a cue or signal.

When I wake up, I make a coffee. When I hear notification, I check the phone. When clock shows 1PM I eat dinner. When I finish job, I clean up the house. And so on.

To promote good habits, we need to **make things obvious**.

One of the things that often drags us from doing things is thinking: what should I do know? X or Z? Should I do it here or other place? Should I do it before work or after work? etc.

### All the details already set

To counter this, we might **simply plan things with place and time**: "I'll excercise yoga everyday at 7 AM in the living room". Since there is **no room for ambiguity**, we either do it or not - all of the details are already set in stone.

To make it even easier, signal for our good habit might be result of completing another habit.<br>
For example - after reading *Atomic Habits* I've decided to help out my back and do half-yoga, half-streching session for 5-10 minutes in the morning.

Instead of simply putting it into calendar with alarm set off on 7AM, I know that everyday I need my coffee to start the day. So I prepare coffee pot (my daily ritual), put it on heat and simply do the stretching after setting coffee pot on fire.

Another thing that also worked for me is placing things that recall me of a habit, so that when I come over, I'll just move on fluently to "doing".
This might be a book that I have around during dinner and that I read after completing the meal. That might also be an iPad, that I sculpt on, that waits for me after an after-work walk.

### Chaining habits

This technique is called **chaining and it allows to build up on something, that we already do** (and do not think about). So that the hesitation part is gone.

Another thing worth mentioning is that motivation (from many points of view) is overrated. It's both repetitiveness, place, people and so on that make actions too easy to just skip. James Cleary generalizes it to **context**.

### Single purpose place

Let's focus on a **context of a place**, since that works well for me.

If I have dedicated place near the table where I eat, where book always waits for me - there is no reason to not read it after I eat.<br>
If there is a place (office space at home) where I always work - I just work there. I do not attempt to read or sculpt (on iPad) there, because there would be too much distraction for me.

When it comes to breaking old habits, perhaphs change of place can help.
Got problem with reading a book daily? Go out with a book after work for 30 minutes, sit on a bench and read it. Bonus points for leaving mobile phone at home!

The same goes for **single purpose electronic devices** - I have computer only for work, computer only for after-hours usage: notes and gaming and tablet: only for creative stuff. I do not mix them up, so that their concerns do not get mixed up too.<br>
When it's gaming PC, it's time for playing. When it's an iPad - it's sculpting or drawing. I cannot play on it, because I simply do not have games on it.


### Removing distractions

Using all of the knowledge about signals from previous points one can also work towards eliminating bad habits.

For example to fight checking every X seconds my phone, I'm simply putting it away at the beginning of my job on the shelf far away.
This way I'm isolating myself from negative signals but also make it unattractive (since I need to go for it to check any notification).

## Craving - make it attractive

Signals seem to be obvious when we think about them. But making good habits last and bad habits go away based on simply that is impossible.

### Coupling with rewarding actions

To tackle this, author proposes enforcing "less likely" (I'll call it "harder to start") actions that we need to do by coupling them with things that we want to do because they're associated with pleasure or reward.

This idea builds of on the fact, that researchers figured out, **that often the craving of something** (like going on holidays, buying something new and shiny etc.) **has more to do with pleasure** (or in more chemical terms: dopamine) **than actually doing it**.

So for example to make working out attractive, we can associate it with playing a video game or watching a movie when we come back home from gym.

The craving for the pleasure afterwards will help us "survive" the things that we have trouble motivating ourselves to do now.

We can use it together with **chaining** but also build up **rituals**, ie. doing the hard thing starts with some pleasure thing forming a ritual as a whole.<br> But this might be tricky - we might just finish the pleasure thing and do not attempt the hard thing at all, right? :) 

### Environment is the king

We've already talked about the place, but also **other people and their value systems strengthen our habits**.
If our colleagues eat junk food on every lunch and we do care about socializing, we'll follow along. That's also a human thing - to follow the pack.

If we want to be a good software engineer it might be a good idea to join a community, were people challenge each other with new ideas, technology news, questions about approaches on XYZ and so on.

Also changing a job where people accept stagnation and do not want to try new things might be a good idea to do (so that we do not stagnate too).

## Response - make it easy

Building habit takes time and steps required to achieve this would be painful to follow if performing them would be hard. We are lazy creatures optimized for conserving energy and going the route of "minimum pain, maximum gain".

### Numerous small steps - practice (ie. repetition) makes perfect

Let's recall that the very first argument of *Atomic Habits* is that cummulation of numerous small steps makes up for a big change over time. Actually, another book that I've just finished - *Philosophy of money* - argues exactly the same about financial aspect of our lifes.

To build the habit, let's make **steps so small that practice is easy**. And the more we practice, the more the action comes natural to start and more natural to come back to when we ommit it.

It's obviously important **to not repeat the same practice all over again** (but it doesn't have to do anything with habits per se).
Repetition should make up for incremental change (like compound intereset mentioned earlier). If we are practicing art of human portaits, doing eyes anatomy for a year straight will make us an amazing eye artist, but the rest of the face would probably be a potato.<br>

That's another thing why reaching a goal of *"I can draw a great human eye"* doesn't make sense.<br>
*"I'm a great portait artist"* is better (and coupled with `identity`) - we will not stop on eye, ears, mouth, hair or any other thing at all. If we identify with being great portait artist, we'll keep on studying anatomy, but also experimenting with different racial features, female and male features and their differences and will keep going back to fundamentals to revisit our understanding of building blocks of human face and so on...

### Deciding moment - the first step

There is some mystery about starting any damn thing. I'm doing software engineering for 10 years and still first 5 to 10 minutes of coding are the hardest in my everyday job. When I'm past them, I'm all in.<br>
Same goes for art, workout and so on.

Cleary points out that actual minimal effort on starting makes up for great part of doing the actual stuff.
And I do agree, based on my experience.

If I'm exhausted and do not want to go running, putting myself in running clothes, running boots and going outside already does the job for me.

I will go running since all the friction is already gone. Also it would be pain in the ass (and sort of frustrating) to now go back and change the clothes again without actually doing anything related (plus shame kicks in too).

Same goes for reading a book. Heard anyone reading only one page of book after opening it?<br>
Doesn't make sense, right? Since you took the effort to open it and read one page, you'll easily snowball to 10, or so.

### Small steps make a routine

Small steps have one more amazing feature - they are super easy to integrate into our everyday routine.<br>
When I've struggled with morning stretching, I decided to do like two or three very short excercises. This was super easy, because they took under a minute to do. There is no excuse for, like, not having one minute a day for excercise, right?

But now it's like 10 excercises. And I've built this up by simply adding "just one more excercise" over time.

**If step is very small, takes little time and almost zero effort, there is no way of telling yourself there is no time to do it.**

### Countering bad practices with the opposite - making them hard

I've already mentioned that I've been fighting mobile addiction and FOMO (as most of the population nowadays). I used to just grab my phone to browse irrelevant stuff out of habit.<br>
Notification kicked in? I'll immediately jump to the phone to check it.

Over time I've (before even reading *Atomic Habits*) to just put the mobile away a little further - out of my hands reach. I've also have most of the distracting stuff (like social media) muted using Android's `Digital Wellbeing` from 9AM to 5PM. And if I want to use them during that time, I'm forced to reenable them manually for 5mins by additional action.

That's a big pain in the ass. And that's probably the only reason why I'm winning this fight (ie. succeeding on most of the days, even when failing to comply on single occasions). 

## Reward - make it satisfactory

We - as humans - are optimized for repeating things that are rewarding and avoiding things that are punishing. And that's something that marketing departments use to tie us up to products like social media. But we can use it to our advantage.

### Track the progress

Let's think of having a healthy BMI. You've planned on working out every day, but - as most of the people - you won't see any difference for at least a few weeks. After few days you'll start to get demotivated and probably resign, since there is no reward in sight.

But we can counter this - for example by tracking our progress. There are multiple apps that support counting how many times we did X.<br>
There might be a time when you'll say: I give up, I cannot do this anymore. Then you'll see your progress tracker and see: wow, I did this 20 times already, would be a waste to give up now, right?

### See what you've done already and what can be lost

What also worked for me when losing weight was tracking my progress through weighing myself daily. Obviously at the beginning workouts gave little to zero effect, but over time I've had a track of losing like 20kg+ total.<br> And even when I saw a peak up after eating a lot on Christmas, I could also see the bigger picture - gaining 2kgs after Xmas was nothing to compare with 20kg lost already.

Just keep going.

### Understand progress you've already made

One more thing about tracking progress in anything we do in life in what we want to succeed is to have **perspective**.

I'm doing software engineering for a decade already and I still struggle with *imposter syndrome*. To fight this, one of the techniques I've used is to track what I've achieved in my career and what have I learned every year (or every half a year, it depends).<br>
This way I can see the perspective of where I was, where I'm now and understand that all what I'm doing did not go in vain.

Same goes with my ambition for being a successful hobbist artist.<br>
Do I make shitty portaits nowadays? Probably.<br>
Are they shitty when compared with what I did 5 years ago? Hell no! They kick ass.

I even push what I've done to social media used by arists like ArtStation or Instagram. Mostly for myself.<br>
So that it's not so easy anymore to say - "I did waste those 2 years practicing art". I can look up my art from any place via Internet and say - alright, this looks pretty good. Still a long way to improve but you're making progress.

And that's the best long-term reward one can get. Seeing the progress over the time as an outcome of not giving up.
