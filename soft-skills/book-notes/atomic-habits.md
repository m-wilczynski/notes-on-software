# Atomic Habits

*Atomic Habits* by James Clear builds up on concepts from *Power of Habit* to support reader with building up desired habits and weeding out bad ones.

## Progress takes time

Most important thing to understand about building, maintaining and profiting from habits like daily workout, writing one page of your book a day, practicing sculpting, drawing or simply learning regularly is that **progress takes time**. 

It's the same for most of the aspects in our life. We build up proficiency in our jobs throughout the years. We accumulate wealth through long-term investments, not by - in general - strike of luck with one good investment on first try.

Everything takes time. But it accumulates. <br>
Everyday progress builds up on progress from previous day.<br>
1% improvement might look small, but like compound interest, it eventually builds up to enormous numbers (or whatever measurement one would use).


## Goal is a lie

James Clear points out an important thing that I've been practicing throghout my career - goals (or at least joy of reaching them) are ephemeral.

Both winners and loosers will both have same goals. But it doesn't make them successful per se.

Instead of focusing on them, one should embrace the systeme of values, the identity of what the change we are looking is embodiment of.

I like to think about this when I think about myself *being a great software engineer*.<br>
Will I become one when I master one programming language? Or two? Or three? Does knowledge of this database, that message broker, that cloud provider or that design pattern will make me a great engineer?

Yes and no. Temporarily and given optimistic circumstances - perhaps. But time flows, technology changes, job market changes, world changes.<br>
Technology XYZ does not make me a great engineer. A path in life - of continous learning, asking the question "why?", trying different problem domains, tackling different categories of problems, playing different roles in a team or organization as a whole.

This doesn't stand for single point of time when it's done. It's a continous process of **being that person**. Of **embracing such identity**.

I like to think about it in one other way, using two (shorter and longer) quotes from Brandon Sanderson's *The Way of Kings*:

>“And so, does the destination matter? Or is it the path we take? I declare that no accomplishment has substance nearly as great as the road used to achieve it. We are not creatures of destinations. It is the journey that shapes us. Our callused feet, our backs strong from carrying the weight of our travels, our eyes open with the fresh delight of experiences lived.”

and the one that summarizes it:

>“Journey before Destination.”

## Cheating oneself into habits

*Atomic Habits* are a self-help book category gem because it does not attempt to trick you into XYZ solution. Instead it points you out, that indeed, we - as humans - are weak and we do optimize for short-term benefits, including mostly reward, pleasure, prize, you name it.

And instead of fighting it, James Cleary shows how to win this fight without actually fighting it.

He focuses on 4 "laws" of habit (both good and bad):
- cue/signal
- craving/desire
- response/reaction
- reward

## Signal - make things obvious

First thing is that starts every habit is a cue or signal.

When I wake up, I make a coffee. When I hear notification, I check the phone. When clock shows 1PM I eat dinner. When I finish job, I clean up the house. And so on.

To promote good habits, we need to **make things obvious**.

One of the things that often drags us from doing things is thinking: what should I do know? X or Z? Should I do it here or other place? Should I do it before work or after work? etc.

### All the details already set

To counter this, we might **simply plan things with place and time**: "I'll excercise yoga everyday at 7 AM in the living room". Since there is **no room for ambiguity**, we either do it or not - all of the details are already set in stone.

To make it even easier, signal for our good habit might be result of completing another habit.<br>
For example - after reading *Atomic Habits* I've decided to help out my back and do half-yoga, half-streching session for 5-10 minutes in the morning.

Instead of simply putting it into calendar with alarm set off on 7AM, I know that everyday I need my coffee to start the day. So I prepare coffee pot (my daily ritual), put it on heat and simply do the stretching after preparing coffee.

Another thing that also worked for me is placing things that recall me of a habit, so that when I come over, I'll just move on fluently to "doing".
This might be a book that I have around during dinner and that I read after completing the meal. That might also be an iPad, that I sculpt on, that waits for me after an after-work walk.

### Chaining habits

This technique is called **chaining and it allows to build up on something, that we already do** (and do not think about). So that the hesitation part is gone.

Another thing worth mentioning is that motivation (from many points of view) is overrated. It's both repetitiveness, place, people and so on that make actions to easy to just skip. James Cleary generalizes it to **context**.

### Single purpose place

Let's focus on a **context of a place**, since that works well for me.

If I have dedicated place near the table where I eat, where book always waits for me - there is no reason to not read it after I eat.<br>
If there is a place (office space at home) where I always work - I just work there. I do not attempt to read or sculpt (on iPad) there, because there would be too much distraction for me.

When it comes to breaking old habits, perhaphs change of place can help.
Got problem with reading a book daily? Go out with a book after work for 30 minutes, sit on a bench and read it. Bonus points for leaving mobile phone at home!

The same goes for **single purpose electronic devices** - I have computer only for work, computer only for after-hours usage: notes and gaming and tablet: only for creative stuff. I do not mix them up, so that their concerns do not get mixed up too.<br>
When it's gaming PC, it's time for playing. When it's an iPad - it's sculpting or drawing. I cannot play on it, because I simply do not have games on it.


### Removing distractions

Using all of the knowledge about signals from previous points one can also work towards eliminating bad habits.

For example to fight checking every X seconds my phone, I'm simply putting it away at the beginning of my job on the shelf far away.
This way I'm isolating myself from negative signals but also make it unattractive (since I need to go for it to check any notification).

## Craving - make it attractive

Signals seem to be obvious when we thing about them. But making good habits last and bad habits go away based on simply that is impossible.

### Coupling with rewarding actions

To tackle this, author proposes enforcing "less likely" (I'll call it "harder to start") actions that we need to do by coupling them with things that we want to do because they're associated with pleasure or reward.

This idea builds of on the fact, that researchers figured out, **that often the craving of something** (like going on holidays, buying something new and shiny etc.) **has more to do with pleasure** (or in more chemical terms: dopamine) **than actually doing it**.

So for example to make working out attractive, we can associate it with playing a video game or watching a movie when we come back home from gym.

The craving for the pleasure afterwards will help us "survive" the things that we have trouble motivating ourselves to do now.

We can use it together with **chaining** but also build up **rituals**, ie. doing the hard thing starts with some pleasure thing forming a ritual as a whole.<br> But this might be tricky - we might just finish the pleasure thing and do not attempt the hard thing at all, right? :) 

### Environment is the king

We've already talked about the place, but also **other people and their value systems strengthen our habits**.
If our colleagues eat junk food on every lunch and we do care about socializing, we'll follow along. That's also a human thing - to follow the pack.

If we want to be a good software engineer it might be a good idea to join a community, were people challenge each other with new ideas, technology news, questions about approaches on XYZ and so on.

Also changing a job where people accept stagnation and do not want to try new things might be a good idea to do (so that we do not stagnate too).
