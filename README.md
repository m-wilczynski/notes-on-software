# Notes on software

You're currently browsing my notes on software that I've decided to write down. üìù

You'll find here notes spanning from very basic or obvious things to complex, analytic articles.

Why, you'd ask? Well... memory is tricky and there are many things understood either through experience, books, tutorials, blogposts, conferences or simple chit-chat that I want to remember.

Lots of people decide to start a blog for this particular reason but I used to have one and wasted way too much time for:
* styling it (I'm looking at you CSS)
* polishing blog posts too much (because hey, audience!)
* worrying that I write posts rarely or make them too short

Why did I choose this form then? Simply:
* I love and trust Git as version control system and GitHub as a hosting platform
* Markdown feels very natural to me
* These are notes, so I don't feel obliged to write comprehensive guides for general public - short stuff just enough to remember the glimpse of something
* Chance to learn [Docsify.js](https://docsify.js.org) was tempting
* I caught myself on losing lots of knowledge gathered from sources mentioned above and started to email myself with notes (which is fine but hard to organize)

Still interested? Then these are general categories on which I generally have something to note on:
* **Software architecture** - *high level design and practices (architecture, system design, general software development practices, analysis and modelling), not so much code*
* **Software engineering** - *low level design and practices - software testing, design patterns, programming models and concepts, computer science, infrastructure, networking, security; language agnostic*
* **Programming languages** - *code snippets in particular language*
* **Frameworks and libraries** - //will merge with Languages// *code snippets in particular framework or library*
* **Tooling** - *tooling, shortcuts etc.*
* **Soft skills** - *soft skills, leadership and also self-development*
